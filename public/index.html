            <h1>Hello Express!</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</p>
        <h2>Web Applications</h2>
        <p>This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.

        Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

        A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.</p>
            <h3>Render basic HTML view?
        </h3>

        <p>When this option is true, client errors such as a bad request or a request to a non-existent file will cause this middleware to simply call next() to invoke the next middleware in the stack. When false, these errors (even 404s), will invoke next(err).

        Set this option to true so you can map multiple physical directories to the same web address or for routes to fill in non-existent files.

        Use false if you have mounted this middleware at a path designed to be strictly a single file system directory, which allows for short-circuiting 404s for less overhead. This middleware will also reply to all methods.</p>
